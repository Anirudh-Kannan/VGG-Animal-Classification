# VGG-Animal-Classification
A convolutional neural network fine tuned on the VGG cnn (with transfer learning) to recognize images of cats, dogs and pandas.
The images are available in the form of a numpy array called data.npy and the corresponding labels are available in target.npy.
The images have been preprocessed and converted to numpy arrays to reduce the training and testing time.


The results obtained are as follows:

Train Accuracy: 1.00
Test loss: 0.085
Test accuracy: 0.98

#### The final model is stored in the 'model.h5' File.
